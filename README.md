# Sorting with Cuda: many small arrays
 Sorting many small arrays with CUDA using dfferent algorithms. The work is in progress. The goal is to implement the best algorithm which will provided the best spatial and temporal locality to minimize register spills.
  
 Usage:
  
> CUDA_Sorting_with_Thrust %number_of_arrays% %size_of_array% %output_folder%
